I really like food and eating delicious meals. I think cats and dogs are pretty cool, but the responsibility of taking care of one seems intimidating. 
I think noodles are the best type of food. Very versatile in cooking styles make it superior. 
I like dumplings a lot as well. It's like a sandwich but tiny and completely wrapped, so that each bite can have an impact of flavor.
